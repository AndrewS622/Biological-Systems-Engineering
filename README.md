# Biological-Systems-Engineering
BME 526 at Stony Brook University

Biological Systems Engineering is a graduate-level biomedical engineering course at Stony Brook University which examines various biological phenomena from a systems engineering perspective by employing computational modeling. The course covers a number of topics and a variety of software tools, including Stella Professional for dynamical systems analysis, Simulink in Matlab for Hodgkin-Huxley modeling, the system identification toolbox in Matlab for dynamic causal modeling, the NetLogo tool for cellular automata, and the Gelphi software for graph theoretic models. A was completed in Matlab Simulink which derived a modified version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model based on the presence of mu opioid G protein-coupled receptors. The included code files are as follows: 

1. Predator-prey dynamics in Stella
2. Pharmacokinetics of drug absorption in Stella
3. Glucose-insulin dynamics in Stella
4. A mathematical model of metabolism in Stella
5. The Hodgkin-Huxley model in Simulink
6. Predicting the EEG-fMRI transfer function from an oddball task using the system identification toolbox
7. The Hurst exponent in glucose-insulin dynamics in Stella
8. Diffusion in solids in NetLogo
9. Mu opioid receptor dynamics in Simulink
